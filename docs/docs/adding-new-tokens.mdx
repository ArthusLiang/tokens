# Tokens Workflow

## General workflow

Creating component tokens is done manually by raising a PR agains the [momentum-design/tokens](https://github.com/momentum-design/tokens) repository.
This is a public repository so anyone should be able to raise a PR with new tokens. Only internal teams can merge and publish new changes.
Here's a [Webex Space](webexteams://im?space=f1c18690-b164-11eb-ad5a-1da905e79d40) where you can ask someone to review your PR (reviewing will be
done regularly by the internal teams, so no need to ask for a review after making a PR every time).

The process is easier explained with an example. In this guide we'll be creating tokens for the [Chips components](https://www.figma.com/file/vdL18BATeJAIq2JvGAjRPD/Components---Web?node-id=40290%3A64182)
and we will be using the Web Library as a referece.

### 1. Creating the component.json file

Most of the components will be under the `/components` folder. In certain cases, there are some components that are only specific to one platform and are placed under `/platformcomponents` instead. Most components should be in the `/components` tho.
In this case, we need to create a file called `chips.json` under the `/components` folder.

### 2. General JSON structure and variants

The main structure for the JSON file should be as shown below. We'll discuss about `component-variation` later.

```json
{
  "componentname": { // all lowercase and no separation between words (no spce, no dash etc)
    "comment": "Provide a small comment about this component",
    "figma": "https://www.figma.com/link/to/compnent/in/figma", // Replace with correct link
    "component-variation-1": {
      ...
    },
    "component-variation-2": {
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

The above structure only works for components that have multiple variations. For example, ButtonPill has a few variations (primary - which has filled colors, secondary - which has outline, ghost - which has no bg on #normal state, etc.).
Some components are more simple and don't have variations. For example TextField doesn't have variations, there is only one design for this component.

### 3. States

On the other hand, components can have multple states and these are usually states resulted from user interacting with the
component (normal, hover, active, focus, etc). Here's an example of a component that only has one variation but that variation has multiple states, the JSON structure will look like this:

```json
{
  "textinput": {
    "comment": "Used for all text inputs and their states",
    "figma": "https://www.figma.com/file/NaNrfXjygZtRgMfHAFHjsp/Components---Windows%2BWeb?node-id=4429%3A871",
    "placeholder-text": "@theme-text-secondary-normal",
    "#normal": {
      "background": "@theme-background-solid-primary-normal",
      "text": "@theme-text-primary-normal",
      "border": "@theme-outline-input-normal"
    },
    "#pressed": {
      "background": "@theme-background-secondary-active",
      "text": "@theme-text-secondary-normal",
      "border": "@theme-outline-input-normal"
    },
    "#hovered": {
      "background": "@theme-background-primary-hover",
      "text": "@theme-text-primary-normal",
      "border": "@theme-outline-input-normal"
    },
    ...
}
```

Here's the initial example with multiple variants but with multiple states:

```json
{
  "componentname": { // all lowercase and no separation between words (no spce, no dash etc)
    "comment": "Provide a small comment about this component",
    "figma": "https://www.figma.com/link/to/compnent/in/figma", // Replace with correct link
    "component-variation-1": {
      "#normal": {
        "background": "@theme-background-solid-primary-normal",
      },
      "#pressed": {
        "background": "@theme-background-secondary-active",
      },
      "#hovered": {
        "background": "@theme-background-primary-hover",
      },
    },
    "component-variation-1": {
      "#normal": {
        "background": "@theme-background-solid-primary-normal",
      },
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

:::caution States Rules

States have 2 rules:

1. State names need to begin with the `#` character. Example #hovered.
2. State names need to be in past tense, with the exception of `#normal` and`#active`. All valid states are `#normal`, `#pressed`, `#hovered`, `#focused`, `#active`, `#disabled`.

### 4. Component items (sub-components)

Each component is build from multiple parts. In our example, Chips are built from 4 parts.

<img src={require("@site/static/img/chips-anatomy.png").default} width="100%" alt="Chips Component Anatomy Diagram" />

##### 1. Container

Chip containers hold all chip elements, and their size is determined by those elements. A container can also be defined by a stroke.

##### 2. Thumbnail / Icon [optional]

Thumbnails identify entities (like individuals) by displaying an avatar, logo, or icon.

##### 3. Text

Chip text can be an entity name, description, tag, action, or conversational.

##### 4. Clear icon [optional]

Input chips can include a Remove icon when a feature requires it.

And here we can see all the variations and states (dark).

<img src={require("@site/static/img/chips-dark-ui.png").default} width="100%" alt="Chips Component UI" />

Therefore, we need our json file to include all variants `filled` and `outline`, and for each variant we have 5 states. Inside each state, we have 4 elements, so our JSON will look like below.

```json
{
  "chip": {
    "comment": "Chip Component",
    "figma": "https://www.figma.com/file/vdL18BATeJAIq2JvGAjRPD/Components---Web?node-id=40290%3A64182",
    "filled": {
      "#normal": {
        "background": "@theme-background-solid-primary-normal",
        "text": "@theme-text-inverted-normal",
        "thumbnail": "@theme-text-inverted-normal",
        "clearIcon": "@theme-text-inverted-normal",
      },
       "#hovered": {
        "background": "@theme-button-primary-hover",
        "text": "@theme-text-inverted-normal",
        "thumbnail": "@theme-text-inverted-normal",
        "clearIcon": "@theme-text-inverted-normal",
      },
      "#pressed": {
       "background": "@theme-button-primary-normal",
        "text": "@theme-text-inverted-hover",
        "thumbnail": "@theme-text-inverted-normal",
        "clearIcon": "@theme-text-inverted-normal",
      },
      "error": {
       "background": "@theme-background-alert-error-normal",
        "text": "@theme-text-error-normal",
        "thumbnail": "@theme-text-error-normal",
        "clearIcon": "@theme-text-error-normal",
      },
      "#disabled": {
        "background": "@theme-button-primary-disabled",
        "text": "@theme-text-inverted-disabled",
        "thumbnail": "@theme-text-inverted-disabled",
        "clearIcon": "@theme-text-inverted-disabled",
      },
    },
    "outline": {
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Finding what color to use for each state/sub-item.

We should generate docs with the figma mapping and the token format used here.

## Tokens & @momentum-ui/react-collaboration Web Libbrary

:::danger Theme Tokens
Consuming theme tokens in the web components library is not allowed! There are a few exceptions, like gradients or backgrounds for
the ThemeProvider component.
:::

When it comes to implementing a new component in the [web library](https://github.com/momentum-design/momentum-react-v2),
you are not allowed to use theme tokens directly (which appear on figma). You are required to create a PR with relevant tokens
and then consume the component tokens instead.
